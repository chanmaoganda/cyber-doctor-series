### Why I write this book
I am currently a junior student majoring in Computer Science at **TianJin University** by `Dec. 6, 2024`.

I was a green hand at coding before entering college. Starting the trial in Computer Science is a tough thing for such a fish like me. What we are taught on class are useless in most cases.

Thus a reference of those modern tools and concepts are included in this book.
